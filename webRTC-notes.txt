** WebRTC ** 

-   Client to client video/file etc. transfer without the use of a server.

-   Works on UDP-protocol (unlike http/websockets that rely on TCP protocol). 
    UDP: fast, but not reliable | TCP: slow, but reliable

-   In client-to-client communication, a client-machine doesn't know what is its public ip address. Without 
    knowing what is its public ip address, it cannot cannot connect to another client in another network directly.
    here comes the concept of TURN/ICE servers. Client sends a request to these server to get the info about the
    public address they were assigned, ip-address form where the info came, etc.

-   Drawback: p2p communication, 3rd person cannot enter. To over come this:
    1.  Mesh Topology - We create a p2p connection to each of the clients creating n(n-1) 
        total peer connections. (Not recommended due to scalablility issue)
    2.  Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) - We create a central-client on the server. Each client make connection
        with that central client, send their video/files, the central-client combines the videos and presents
        it to the user.
